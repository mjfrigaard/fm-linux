Thank you for your patience.\n\n::: \n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Linux environments, the terms 'Shell' and 'Terminal' are commonly used and although they are related, they actually refer to different things: A **terminal** (or terminal emulator) is a software program that provides a text-based interface to the **shell**, the program that processes user commands--which might also involve calling other programs--and returns the output. \n\nBelow is an expanded look at some commonly used terminal emulators and their key features.\n\n## ![](img/gnome-logo.png){fig-align=\"right\" width=\"12%\"} [GNOME]{style=\"font-weight: bold;\"}\n\n[GNOME](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/) is the default terminal emulator for the GNOME desktop environment, widely used in many Linux distributions.\n\n:::{#fig-gnome}\n\n![](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/figures/gnome-terminal.png){#fig-gnome fig-align='center'}\n\nRead more about the GNOME Terminal in the [official documentation.](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/introduction.html.en)\n:::\n\n### Key features\n\n**Profiles**\n\nUsers can create multiple profiles, each with its own set of preferences, including colors, fonts, and keyboard shortcuts.\n\n**Tabs and Splitting**\n\nSupports opening multiple tabs and can split the terminal window into multiple panes.\n\n**Transparency and Backgrounds**\n\nAllows setting background images and adjusting the transparency of the terminal window.\n\n**Compatibility**\n\nSupports UTF-8 for a wide range of characters, making it suitable for international use.\n\n## ![](img/konsole-logo.jpeg){fig-align=\"right\" width=\"12%\"} [Konsole]{style=\"font-weight: bold;\"}\n\n[Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/) is part of the KDE desktop environment. It is known for its deep integration with KDE and its high degree of customizability.\n\n:::{#fig-konsole}\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*gIK9EXCqVo2wmPB2SmXR4A.png){#fig-konsole fig-align='center'}\n\nRead how to customize your Konsole terminal in [KDE Users: Up Your Konsole Game](https://medium.com/for-linux-users/kde-users-up-your-konsole-game-720d3ab799b8) by [Al Williams](https://medium.com/@al-williams)\n:::\n\n\n### Key features\n\n\n**Tabbed Interface**\n\nAllows multiple tabs within a single window, facilitating multitasking.\n\n**Profiles**\n\nSupports multiple profiles, enabling different settings for each session.\n\n**Split Views**\n\nUsers can split Konsole windows horizontally or vertically.\n\n**Transparency and Theming**\n\nSupports background transparency and themes, which can be customized easily.\n\n## ![](img/iterm2-logo.png){fig-align=\"right\" width=\"12%\"} [iTerm2]{style=\"font-weight: bold;\"}\n\n[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) is a replacement for Terminal and the successor to iTerm for macOS. It offers features beyond what traditional terminals provide.\n\n::: {#fig-iterm2}\n\n![](img/iterm2-cowsay.png)\n\nExecution of [`feature`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/fortune) and [`cowsay`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/cowsay) in [`iterm2` on macOS](https://iterm2.com/) \n:::\n\n\n\n### Key features \n\n**Split Panes**\n\nUsers can divide iTerm2 into multiple panes, each with its own session.\n\n**Search**\n\niTerm2 allows users to search through text and highlights occurrences.\n\n**Profiles**\n\nSupports detailed profiles, each with its custom colors, fonts, window transparency, and key bindings.\n\n**Advanced Paste Features**\n\nOffers a paste history and allows pasting with escape codes to avoid issues with unintended command executions.\n\n**Mouseless Copy**\n\niTerm2 lets you use keyboard shortcuts to select and copy text without needing the mouse.\n\n**Shell Integration**\n\niTerm2 can integrate with the shell to display badges, track command statuses, and more.\n\n**Trigger Support**\n\nExecutes user-defined actions based on text output to the terminal.\n\n## [Recap]{style=\"font-size: 1.05em; font-weight: bold;\"}\n\nEach of these terminal emulators offers unique features that cater to different needs and preferences, enhancing the user's command-line experience. Whether you need deep customization, minimal resource usage, or advanced functionalities like search and shell integration, there's a terminal emulator that fits the requirement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::: {.callout-note collapse='false' appearance='simple' icon=false}\n\n## [See a typo, error, or something missing?]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.15em;'}\n\n::: {style='font-size: 1.00em; color: #282b2d;'}\n\n\nPlease open an issue on [GitHub.](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/fm-unix/issues/new)\n\n::: \n\n::::\n",
