Text commands and editors form the backbone of these operating systems, enabling users to perform complex tasks with a few keystrokes. This chapter will delve into the fundamental concepts of plain text files, text streams, and the Unix philosophy that prioritizes text as a universal interface for programming and system administration.\n\n## Plain Text Files\n\nAt the heart of Unix and Linux systems are plain text files. Unlike rich text files with formatting and specialized metadata, plain text files contain only text data. This simplicity makes them incredibly versatile and universally readable. Configuration files, scripts, and even the source code for the entire operating system itself are stored as plain text, ensuring that they can be created, edited, and read with a wide array of tools without the need for specialized software.\n\n## Text Streams\n\nA text stream in Unix and Linux is a simple, sequential flow of characters. Text streams can be inputs from keyboards, outputs to a display screen, or the data within a file. The concept of text streams is fundamental to the Unix philosophy; it allows for the chaining together of commands, where the output of one command can be seamlessly passed as input to another through a mechanism known as piping. This interconnectivity of commands and utilities, all communicating through text streams, exemplifies the efficiency and flexibility of Unix-like systems.\n\n## Text and The Unix Philosophy\n\nThe Unix philosophy emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and the principle of “doing one thing well.” Plain text embodies this philosophy, serving as a simple, straightforward, and versatile means of interaction between the user, the system, and the programs running on it. It allows for complex operations to be broken down into smaller, manageable tasks that can be easily combined or modified. This philosophy also underpins the design of Unix text editors, which range from the simple (like nano) to the powerful and extensible (like vi and emacs).\n\nText commands and editors are not just tools but the medium through which users communicate with the system and manipulate it to their will. Mastering these commands and editors opens up a world of possibilities for efficient system management, programming, and beyond.\n\nThis chapter will explore the core text commands that every Unix and Linux user should know, from file manipulation to text processing and searching. We will also introduce the most popular text editors, guiding you through their primary usage and highlighting their unique features. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::: {.callout-note collapse='false' appearance='default' icon=false}\n\n## [See a typo, error, or something missing?]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.95em;'}\n\n::: {style='font-size: 0.90em; color: #282b2d;'}\n\n\nPlease open an issue on [GitHub.](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/fm-unix/issues/new)\n\n::: \n\n::::",
