This book aims\nto provide a clear understanding of the concepts and commands of\nUnix/Linux, even for non-technical audiences. Whether you are a student,\na professional from a non-IT field, or someone curious about operating\nsystems, this book will guide you through the essentials of Unix/Linux.\n\n## Preface\n\nUnix and Linux are powerful, versatile, and widely used operating\nsystems that run on millions of devices worldwide, from smartphones to\nsupercomputers. Learning about Unix/Linux can open doors to many career\nopportunities and help you better understand the digital world around\nyou.\n\nThis book is structured to gradually introduce you to the Unix/Linux\nenvironment, starting from the basics to more complex concepts. Here`s\nwhat each section covers:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe introduction acquaints you with some background that formed the\nlandscape of Unix/Linux systems. It explains the Bash shell, a\ncommand-line interface (CLI), which is the gateway to leveraging the\nfull potential of Unix/Linux systems.\n\n**Set-Up**: Before diving into the commands and scripts, setting up your\nUnix/Linux environment is crucial. This section guides you through\nvarious options for setting up Unix/Linux on your machine, be it\nnatively or through a virtual machine.\n\n**Syntax**: Understanding the syntax is vital for effectively\ncommunicating with the Unix/Linux system. This section demystifies the\nstructure of commands, including how to differentiate between commands,\narguments, and options and manage inputs and outputs. This knowledge is\ncritical to executing tasks efficiently in the command line.\n\n**Files and Folders**: Navigating and managing files and folders are\ndaily tasks for Unix/Linux users. This section covers essential commands\nsuch as `cd` for changing directories, `pwd` to print the current\ndirectory, `ls` for listing files, and `mkdir` for making directories.\nIt also explores file manipulation commands like `cp` (copy), `mv`\n(move), `rm` (remove), and `less` for viewing file content, ensuring you\ncan organize and manage your file system effectively. These commands are\nthe building blocks for more complex operations in Unix/Linux.\n\n**Manipulate Text**: Unix/Linux systems are renowned for their powerful\ntext manipulation capabilities. This section introduces commands such as\n`cat` for displaying file contents, `grep` for searching within\nfiles, `sort` for sorting data, `uniq` for filtering unique lines, and\n`cut`, `paste`, and `join` for editing files. Mastering these commands\nwill allow you to handle and process text data efficiently.\n\n**Pipes**: Pipes are a cornerstone of Unix/Linux productivity, enabling\nthe output of one command to serve as the input to another. This section\ncovers how to combine commands using `stdout` and `stdin`, allowing for\nrobust command chains that can perform complex tasks with a simple\nsyntax. Understanding pipes unlocks a higher level of command-line\nefficiency and is a step towards advanced Unix/Linux usage.\n\n**Shell Scripts (in development)**\n\nShell scripting is a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks in\nUnix/Linux. This section introduces you to writing your shell scripts,\ncovering the basics of script creation, execution, and debugging. You`ll\nlearn how to automate simple tasks, making your Unix/Linux experience\nmore productive and enjoyable.\n\n**Formats**: Shell scripts can be written in various formats, depending\non your shell (e.g., Bash, Zsh). This section delves into the\ndifferences between these formats, guiding you on writing compatible\nscripts that can run across different Unix/Linux systems.\n\n**Permissions**: Understanding file permissions is crucial to managing\nthe security of your files and directories in Unix/Linux. This section\nexplains how Unix/Linux permissions work and teaches you how to set and\nmodify permissions to protect your data and system from unauthorized\naccess.\n\nBy the end of this book, you`ll have a solid understanding of the\nUnix/Linux operating system. You`ll be equipped to navigate, manage\nfiles, write scripts, and set permissions confidently. Whether you`re\nlooking to enhance your career prospects, manage your Unix/Linux\nsystems, or simply satisfy your curiosity, this book will be your\ncompanion on a fascinating journey into the world of Unix/Linux.\n\n## <!--# What This Book Is Not   -->\n\n## <!--# Audience and Prerequisites -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::: {.callout-note collapse='false' appearance='default' icon=false}\n\n## [See a typo, error, or something missing?]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.95em;'}\n\n::: {style='font-size: 0.90em; color: #282b2d;'}\n\n\nPlease open an issue on [GitHub.](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/fm-unix/issues/new)\n\n::: \n\n::::\n",
