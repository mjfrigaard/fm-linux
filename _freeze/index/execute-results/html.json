This book is designed with the non-technical audience in mind, providing a clear understanding of the concepts and commands of Unix/Linux to make them accessible to everyone. Whether you are a student, a professional from a non-IT field, or merely someone curious about operating systems, this book will guide you through the essentials of Unix/Linux.\n\n## Preface\n\nUnix and Linux are powerful, versatile, and widely used operating systems that run on millions of devices worldwide, from smartphones to supercomputers. Learning about Unix/Linux opens doors to many career opportunities and equips you with the knowledge to understand the digital world around you better.\n\nThis book is structured to gradually introduce you to the Unix/Linux environment, starting from the basics to more complex concepts. Here is the summary of what each section covers:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis section will begin with some Unix/Linux command-line basics.\n\n-   **Set-Up**: Before diving into the commands and scripts, it's essential to have your Unix/Linux environment ready. This section will guide you through setting up Unix/Linux on your machine, be it natively or through a virtual machine. We will ensure that you have a solid foundation to learn and practice the commands and scripts discussed in the subsequent sections.\n\n-   **Commands**: The command line is at the core of Unix/Linux, offering a powerful way to interact with the operating system. In this section, you will learn basic commands for navigating the file system, managing files and directories, and obtaining system information. These commands are the building blocks for more complex operations in Unix/Linux.\n\n-   **Pipes**: Pipes are a unique feature in Unix/Linux that allows you to combine multiple commands to perform complex tasks. This section will introduce the concept of pipes, teaching you how to redirect the output of one command to the input of another, thereby enabling efficient data processing and manipulation.\n\n**Shell Scripts**\n\nShell scripting is a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks in Unix/Linux. This section will introduce you to writing your shell scripts, covering the basics of script creation, execution, and debugging. You'll learn how to automate simple tasks, making your Unix/Linux experience more productive and enjoyable.\n\n-   **Formats**: Shell scripts can be written in various formats, depending on the shell you're using (e.g., Bash, Zsh). This section delves into the differences between these formats, guiding you on writing compatible scripts that can run across different Unix/Linux systems.\n\n-   **Permissions**: Understanding file permissions is crucial for managing the security of your files and directories in Unix/Linux. This section will explain how Unix/Linux permissions work, teaching you how to set and modify permissions to protect your data and system from unauthorized access.\n\nBy the end of this book, you'll have a solid understanding of the Unix/Linux operating system and will be equipped with the knowledge to navigate, manage files, write scripts, and set permissions confidently. Whether you're looking to enhance your career prospects, manage your Unix/Linux systems, or merely satisfy your curiosity, this book will be your companion on a fascinating journey into the world of Unix/Linux.\n\n## <!--# What This Book Is Not   -->\n\n## <!--# Audience and Prerequisites -->\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nwhoami\n## mjfrigaard\n```\n:::\n",
