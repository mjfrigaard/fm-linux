Thank you for your patience.\n\n::: \n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n\nI began writing this book when I started a new position as a Posit System Administrator with CDC's Enterprise Data, Analytics, and Visualization (EDAV) platform.[^edav] EDAV houses multiple enterprise data science products (Databricks, Power BI, Tableau, SAS Viya, etc.) including Posit Workbench, Connect, and Package Manager. The chapters contain the topics and tools I encountered regularly in my daily work (and some on my wish list).\n\n[^edav]: Read more about EDAV and the Data Modernization Initiative [here](https://www.cdc.gov/data-modernization/php/technologies/edav.html).\n\n## [Book outline]{style=\"font-size: 1.05em; font-weight: bold;\"}\n\nThis book is structured to gradually introduce you to the Linux environment, starting from the basics to more complex concepts, then covering multiple case studies.[^zsh-bash]\n\n[^zsh-bash]: Most of these commands will work on any Shell (Zsh, Bash, etc.) program.\n\nThe first four sections of this manual cover concepts and materials for users who are new to Linux. If you're familiar with command-line tools and regular expressions, feel free to skip these chapters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::: {.callout-tip collapse='true' appearance='default' icon='false'}\n\n## [What is in a Field Manual?]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.10em;'}\n\n::: {style='font-size: 0.95em; color: #282b2d;'}\n\n\nA field manual (FM) is an educational tool that provides information, instructions, and techniques for various concepts and practices. \n  \nFiels Manuals function as both reference material and living documentation, encouraging updates and adaptations based on the given situation, available technology, or broader environment.[^field-manuals]\n\n![Example improvised litter made using tent poles and field jackets.](img/jacket-pole-litter.png){width='70%' fig-align='center'}\n  \n[^field-manuals]: This definition is based on the [U.S. Army Field Manuals (FMs).](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/fm-unix/tree/main/_assets/1965-fm531-boobytraps.pdf)\n\n::: \n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe <strong>@sec-intro</strong> acquaints you with some background that formed the landscape of Unix systems. It explains the shell, a command-line interface (CLI), which is the gateway to leveraging the full potential of Linux.\n\n### Set-Ups\n\nBefore diving into writing commands and scripts, setting up your Linux environment is crucial. <strong>[Set-ups](setups.qmd)</strong> guides you through various options for setting up <strong>@sec-sh-term</strong>, <strong>@sec-vms</strong>, and <strong>@sec-quarto</strong> documents.\n\n### The Basics\n\nNavigating and managing files and folders are daily tasks for Linux users. <strong>@sec-dirs</strong> covers essential commands such as `cd` for changing directories, `pwd` to print the current directory, `ls` for listing files, and `mkdir` for making directories.\n\nThe <strong>@sec-files</strong> chapter covers file manipulation commands like `cp` (copy), `mv` (move), `rm` (remove), and `less` for viewing file content, ensuring you can organize and manage your file system effectively. These commands are the building blocks for more complex operations in Linux.\n\n<strong>@sec-sys</strong> goes over common system commands like `top` for monitoring processes in real-time, `ps` for listing currently running processes, `kill` to stop a process, `df` (Disk Free) to display disk space usage on all mounted filesystems, and `du` (Disk Usage) to estimate file space usage. These commands help manage the system's processes and resources efficiently, ensuring a clear view of resource allocation and consumption.\n\n### Syntax\n\nUnderstanding the shell syntax is vital for effectively communicating with a Linux system. The <strong>[Syntax](syntax.qmd)</strong> section demystifies the structure of commands, including how to differentiate between <strong>@sec-commands</strong>, <strong>@sec-args</strong>, and <strong>@sec-options</strong> and manage inputs and outputs. This knowledge is critical to executing tasks reliably at the command line.\n\n<strong>@sec-pipes</strong> are a cornerstone of Linux productivity, enabling the output of one command to serve as the input to another. <strong>[Syntax](syntax.qmd)</strong> also covers how to combine commands using `stdout` and `stdin`, allowing for robust command chains that can perform complex tasks. Understanding pipes unlocks a higher level of command-line efficiency.\n\n### Manipulating Text\n\nLinux systems are renowned for their powerful text manipulation capabilities. <strong>[Text](text.qmd)</strong> covers using <strong>@sec-symbols-patterns</strong> to build regular expressions (regex). <strong>@sec-txt-cmds</strong> introduces commands such as `cat` for displaying file contents, `grep` for searching within files, `sort` for sorting data, `uniq` for filtering unique lines, and `cut`, `paste`, and `join` for editing files. Mastering these commands will allow you to handle and process text data efficiently. <strong>[Text Editors](text_editors.qmd)</strong> covers nano, vim, and emacs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::::: {.column-margin}\n\n:::: {.callout-warning collapse='true' appearance='default' icon='false'}\n\n## [Under Development]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.95em;'}\n\n::: {style='font-size: 0.95em; color: #282b2d;'}\n\n\nThank you for your patience.\n\n::: \n\n::::\n\n:::::\n\n\n\n\n\n### Shell Scripts \n\nShell scripting is a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks in Linux. This section introduces writing shell scripts, covering the basics of script creation, execution, and debugging. We'll discuss how to automate simple tasks, making Linux tasks productive and enjoyable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::::: {.column-margin}\n\n:::: {.callout-warning collapse='true' appearance='default' icon='false'}\n\n## [Under Development]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.95em;'}\n\n::: {style='font-size: 0.95em; color: #282b2d;'}\n\n\nThank you for your patience.\n\n::: \n\n::::\n\n:::::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe <strong>[Format](format.qmd)</strong> chapter delves into the differences between these formats, guiding you on writing compatible scripts that can run across different Linux systems. <strong>[Permissions](permissions.qmd)</strong> explains how Linux permissions work and teaches you how to set and modify permissions to protect your data and system from unauthorized access.\n\n### Use cases \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::::: {.column-margin}\n\n:::: {.callout-warning collapse='true' appearance='default' icon='false'}\n\n## [Under Development]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.95em;'}\n\n::: {style='font-size: 0.95em; color: #282b2d;'}\n\n\nThank you for your patience.\n\n::: \n\n::::\n\n:::::\n\n\n\n\n\n## [Data files]{style=\"font-size: 1.05em; font-weight: bold;\"}\n\nThe data files used in this book are documented in [`data/README.md`](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/fm-unix/tree/main/data/README.md).\n\n## [Recap]{style=\"font-size: 1.05em; font-weight: bold;\"}\n\nBy the end of this book, you'll have a solid understanding of the Linux operating system. You'll be equipped to navigate, manage files, write scripts, and set permissions confidently. Whether you're looking to enhance your career prospects, manage a new system, or simply satisfy your curiosity, this book will be your companion on a fascinating journey into the world of Linux.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::: {.callout-note collapse='false' appearance='simple' icon=false}\n\n## [See a typo, error, or something missing?]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.15em;'}\n\n::: {style='font-size: 1.00em; color: #282b2d;'}\n\n\nPlease open an issue on [GitHub.](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/fm-unix/issues/new)\n\n::: \n\n::::\n",
