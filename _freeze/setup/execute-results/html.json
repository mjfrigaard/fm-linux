However, you can also use Quarto to run Unix commands--specifically, Bash.[^quarto-bash] \n\n[^quarto-bash]: Follow these instructions on the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html#shell-commands) to configure your HTML documents to run Bash code chunks. \n\n### Document header\n\nSpecify the `engine` field of in the YAML header of the `.qmd` file, and any `knitr` chunk options:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Using Bash\"\nengine: knitr\nknitr:\n  opts_chunk: \n    collapse: true\n---\n```\n\n### Code Chunks\n\n> \"*Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.*\" - [Donald Knuth. \"Literate Programming (1984)\" in Literate Programming. CSLI, 1992, pg. 99.](http://www.literateprogramming.com/index.html)\n\nQuarto documents are written in markdown, a lightweight markup language thatâ€™s easy to write and read. This simplicity allows authors to focus on their content rather than formatting. One of the powerful aspects of Quarto is its ability to integrate executable code chunks into Markdown documents (in fact, this entire book was created using markdown and executable code chunks).\n\n```{{bash}}\necho \"foo\" \n```\n\nYou can also specify the code chunk options with the hash-pipe (`#|`):\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\" code-summary=\"show/hide echo\"}\necho \"foo\"\n## foo\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n```{{bash}}\n#| code-fold: show\n#| code-summary: 'show/hide echo'\necho \"foo\" \n```\n\n\n\n## Terminal (macOS)\n\n## Virtual Machines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::: {.callout-note collapse='false' appearance='default' icon=false}\n\n## [See a typo, error, or something missing?]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.95em;'}\n\n::: {style='font-size: 0.90em; color: #282b2d;'}\n\n\nPlease open an issue on [GitHub.](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/fm-unix/issues/new)\n\n::: \n\n::::",
