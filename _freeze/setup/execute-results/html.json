This simplicity allows authors to focus on their content rather than formatting. Quarto documents contain a @sec-yaml header for configuring various options. To run Bash commands, specify `knitr` in the `engine` field of in the YAML header of the `.qmd` file, and any additional key-value pairs:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Using Bash\"\nengine: knitr\nknitr:\n  opts_chunk: \n    collapse: true\n---\n```\n\n### Bash Code Chunks\n\nIntroduced in 1989, Bash has become the default command-line interface or \"shell\" for most Linux distributions.[^bash-macos] We'll use Bash commands and scripts to preproceess data files, render Quarto documents, and automate other operations in the data analysis pipeline, from downloading and ingesting data to creating and deploying analysis outputs.  \n\n[^bash-macos]: Bash was the default command-line interface for Apple's macOS (which is Unix-based) until the transition to `zsh` as the default shell in macOS Catalina.\n\nOne of the powerful aspects of Quarto is its ability to integrate executable code chunks into Markdown documents (in fact, this entire book was created using markdown and executable code chunks).\n\n```{{bash}}\necho \"foo\" \n```\n\nYou can also specify the code chunk options with the hash-pipe (`#|`):[^quarto-bash] \n\n[^quarto-bash]: Follow these instructions on the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html#shell-commands) to configure your HTML documents to run Bash code chunks.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code  code-fold=\"show\" code-summary=\"show/hide echo\"}\necho \"foo\"\n## foo\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n```{{bash}}\n#| code-fold: show\n#| code-summary: 'show/hide echo'\necho \"foo\" \n```\n\n\n## Terminal (macOS)\n\n## Virtual Machines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::: {.callout-note collapse='false' appearance='default' icon=false}\n\n## [See a typo, error, or something missing?]{style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.95em;'}\n\n::: {style='font-size: 0.90em; color: #282b2d;'}\n\n\nPlease open an issue on [GitHub.](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/fm-unix/issues/new)\n\n::: \n\n::::",
