When presented with a new map, the most important thing to find is your location on it. It's hard to know where you're going without knowing where you are. 

#### `pwd` {#sec-pwd}

**`pwd` (Print Working Directory)** tells you exactly where you are in the filesystem.

```{bash}
pwd # where am I?
```

#### `cd` {#sec-cd}

 **`cd` (Change Directory)** lets you move to a different folder on your computer.

If you want to move from the one place to another, `cd` can get you there. For example, `cd /bin` takes you to the `/bin` folder, the toolshed of software tools.

```{bash}
cd /bin # change location
pwd # now where am I?
```

#### `ls` {#sec-ls}

**`ls` (List)** is like standing in one location, looking around, and seeing what files and folders are around you. In `/bin`, `ls` would show you the software tools available:

```{bash}
cd /bin # change location
ls # what's in here?
```

#### `file` {#sec-file}

**`file`** gives you a summary of what a computer file is or what it contains, like telling you if a tool in `/bin/pax` is a program you can run or a text file.

```{bash}
file /bin/pax
```

#### `less` {#sec-less}

**`less`** lets you skim through a file on your computer, moving forwards and backwards as you please.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
less data/gamehof.tsv
```

![Enter `less` in the Terminal to scroll](img/less.gif){width='100%' fig-align='center'}

```{r}
#| label: git_contrib_box
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
git_contrib_box()
