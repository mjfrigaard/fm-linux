#### `mkdir`

**`mkdir` (Make Directory)** builds a new folder wherever you tell it to, like making a new folder for projects in `/bin` (although you typically wouldn't do that there)

#### `cp`

**`cp` (Copy)** duplicates files or folders. For instance, copying a tool from `/bin` to your desktop, but usually, you leave `/bin` tools where they are.

#### `mv`

- **`mv` (Move)**: Taking a book from your desk and putting it on the shelf, `mv` moves files or folders from one place to another. It's like moving a misplaced tool back into `/bin`.

#### `rm`

**`rm` (Remove)**: Throwing away an old, tattered magazine, `rm` deletes files or folders. Be cautious, as this is like shredding documentsâ€”no easy way to get them back.

#### `ln`

**`ln` (Link)**: Creating a shortcut on your desktop to a frequently used program, `ln` creates links to files, making them accessible from multiple places without duplicating them.
