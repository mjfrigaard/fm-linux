[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an '*open-source scientific and technical publishing system*' that enables users to create dynamic and beautiful documents, reports, presentations, and dashboards. 

:::

It is particularly useful for those looking to combine Unix/Linux command line operations with document creation, offering a way to embed executable code within documents. The next sections will guide you through downloading and installing Quarto, `.qmd` documents, `YAML` headers and Bash code chunks.


## [Install]{style="font-size: 1.05em; font-weight: bold;"}

Quarto can be installed from its [official website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). Follow the platform-specific instructions to install it on your system. Make sure Quarto has been installed correctly and is available in your system’s `PATH`.

Check if Quarto is in `PATH`:

```{bash}
#| eval: true
#| code-fold: false
quarto --version
```

If the Quarto version isn't on your `PATH`, you'll need to add the location of your quarto installation to `PATH`. You can do that with the commands below (depending on your shell).

:::{layout="[20,80]" layout-valign="center"}

**Bash**:[^bash-macos]

``` sh
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/quarto"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Zsh**:[^zsh-macos]

``` sh
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/quarto"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

:::

[^bash-macos]: Bash is common in Linux and older macOS versions

[^zsh-macos]: Zsh is now the default in shell in macOS

You can also use `which` to locate quarto path: 

```{bash}
#| eval: true
#| code-fold: false
which quarto
```

On macOS, you can use `find` in the Terminal: 

```bash
find / -name quarto 2>/dev/null
```

## [Quarto Documents]{style="font-size: 1.05em; font-weight: bold;"}

Quarto documents are a flexible and powerful tool for creating dynamic and reproducible reports, presentations, and publications. Quarto documents can support multiple programming languages, including R, Python, Julia, and Bash. Users can combine narrative text with code in a single document, rendering it into various formats like HTML, PDF, and Word. 

This feature proves not only invaluable for data scientists, but for anyone looking to learn a new programming language. Quarto documents are a perfect 'sandbox' to experiment with code, take notes, and review the outputs. Moreover, Quarto has the supports cross-referencing, advanced layout options, and beautiful web and book publishing workflows.[^quarto-book]

[^quarto-book]: In fact, this [entire book](https://github.com/mjfrigaard/fm-unix/tree/main) was written using Quarto documents.

Quarto documents consist of the following elements:

1. **YAML Header**: This is used to specify the document's title, author, and output format.

2. **Narrative Text**: Plain language explanations and context.

3. **Code Chunks**: Executable code blocks from languages like R, Python, Bash, or Julia.

Additional features include:

-   **Results**: the output is displayed directly from the executable code chunks (tables, graphs, etc.).

-   **Cross-references and Citations**: Link to figures, tables, sections, or reference bibliographic sources.

-   **Figures and Tables**: Markdown syntax can be used to add images and tables.

-   **Appendices and Bibliography**: Footnotes and references.

If you decide to use Quarto documents, you'll need to decide on the tool (or development environment) you want to use. At the time of this writing, Quarto has tutorials for getting started in [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), or a text editor (like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)).[^rstudio-quarto-dev]

[^rstudio-quarto-dev]: For what its worth, I've been using RStudio for years and love it. However, I've also used Quarto in VS Code and love many of it's features. 

```{r}
#| label: co_box_knuth
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
co_box(
  color = "b",
  look = "default", 
  hsize = "1.15", 
  size = "1.05", 
  header = "Literate Programming", 
  fold = TRUE,
  contents = "
Literate programming is a programming paradigm that intertwines code with human-readable narrative, allowing programmers to write programs in the order best suited for human understanding. Donald Knuth developed this approach to make code more understandable and maintainable.
  
> '*Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.*' - [Donald Knuth. Literate Programming (1984) in Literate Programming. CSLI, 1992, pg. 99.](http://www.literateprogramming.com/index.html)
  
Literate programming can foster clearer communication of complex programming concepts and enhances collaboration among developers.")
```

### YAML header {#sec-quarto-yaml}

<code>@sec-yaml</code> is a lightweight markup language that’s easy to write and read. In Quarto, the `YAML` header is used to configure document properties such as the title, engine, output format, and more. It serves as the foundation for controlling how your Quarto document behaves and appears.

Quarto documents are written in markdown and can include executable code in various programming languages, including Unix commands. The `YAML` header is placed between three dashes `---` at the top of each Quarto document to specify metadata and global options. 

```yaml
---
title: "Using Bash"
---
```

To run Bash commands, specify `knitr` in the `engine` field of in the `YAML` header of the Quarto file, and any additional key-value pairs:[^shell-reference]

```yaml
---
title: "Using Bash"
engine: knitr
knitr:
  opts_chunk: 
    collapse: true
---
```

[^shell-reference]: Read more about configuring shell code blocks in Quarto in the [documentation.](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html#shell-commands)

### Code Chunks {#sec-quarto-bash}

One of the powerful features of Quarto is the ability to integrate executable code chunks into Markdown documents. You can create bash code chunks using the following syntax:

```{{bash}}
echo "foo" 
```

Bash code chunks allow you to include executable commands within your Quarto documents. You can also specify the code chunk options with the hash-pipe (`#|`):[^quarto-chunk-opts] 

```{{bash}}
#| code-fold: show
#| code-summary: 'show/hide echo'
echo "foo" 
```

When the document is rendered, the narrative text is included with the output from the commnads.

```{bash}
#| code-fold: show 
#| code-summary: 'show/hide echo'
echo "foo"
```

[^quarto-chunk-opts]: Consult the full list of code chunk options in the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html). 

 This simplicity allows authors to focus on their content rather than formatting. 
 
### Code Chunk Isolation

When incorporating Bash code chunks into Quarto documents, an essential detail to remember is the behavior of the working directory during file rendering. By default, Quarto sets the working directory to the location of the current document within the project.

Consider the following scenario in a Quarto project:

```{bash}
#| label: show-current-directory
# This code chunk displays the current working directory
pwd
```

Although we can navigate to a different directory within a given code chunk:

```{bash}
cd data # Change the current working directory to 'data' 
pwd # confirm the change
```

It's crucial to note that Quarto resets the working directory to the document's location for each new code chunk:

```{bash}
# Verifying the working directory, which reverts to 
pwd # the document's location for each new code chunk
```

This behavior is different than what we'd see in Posit Workbench's Terminal on my local machine:

1. Assume the current working directory is `~/projects/` (as indicated by the blue highlighted area in the Terminal pane) 

![~/projects/](img/pwd-local-01.png){width='100%'}

2. If we change my working directory with `..`, we are in the home directory `~`.

![~/](img/pwd-local-02.png){width='100%'}

3. When we check the current working directory again with `pwd`, we see the location has been *permanently* changed to `~`. 

![Still ~/](img/pwd-local-03.png){width='100%'}

This behavior can be frustrating, but it also means we'll start with a 'clean slate' in each new code chunk!

```{r}
#| label: git_contrib_box
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
#| eval: true
git_contrib_box()
```
