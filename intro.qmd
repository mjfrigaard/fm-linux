> "*Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.*" - [Donald Knuth. "Literate Programming (1984)" in Literate Programming. CSLI, 1992, pg. 99.](http://www.literateprogramming.com/index.html)
